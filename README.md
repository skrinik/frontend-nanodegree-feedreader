## How To run

**To Run Locally** simply download/(or clone, see [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) on cloning) the project the link from github in the upper right hand corner. Download the project files and unzip them in a chosen directory. You can simply open the ```index.html``` file in your browser, or start your terminal and use python's SimpleHTTPServer command to host the files locally:

```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000``` to host on port 8000.

Open your browser and go to ```localhost:8000```.

## Notes

All Jasmine functions will run by default since the Jasmine script is self-invoking. Simply run ```index.html``` and you're good to go.
